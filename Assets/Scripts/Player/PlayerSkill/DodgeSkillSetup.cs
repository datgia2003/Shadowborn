                    DODGE SKILL - INPUT SYSTEM VERSION SETUP
===============================================================================

ðŸŽ¯ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. PLAYER SETUP:
   âœ… Attach DodgeSkill.cs to your Player GameObject
   âœ… Ensure Player has PlayerInput component with PlayerInputActions
   âœ… Make sure "Gameplay" action map is active

2. INPUT ACTIONS CONFIGURATION:
   âœ… PlayerInputActions.inputactions already has "Dodge" action
   âœ… Dodge action is bound to "L" key
   âœ… Move action provides direction input for dodge direction

3. REQUIRED COMPONENTS:
   âœ… PlayerInput (with PlayerInputActions asset)
   âœ… Rigidbody2D 
   âœ… PlayerController
   âœ… PlayerResources
   âœ… SpriteRenderer (for visual effects)
   âœ… AudioSource (optional, for sounds)

4. UI INTEGRATION:
   âœ… Create SkillUISlot with skillName = "Dodge"
   âœ… System automatically connects and shows L key

ðŸŽ® HOW IT WORKS:

INPUT SYSTEM CALLBACKS:
- OnDodge(InputValue) â†’ Triggered when L key pressed
- OnMove(InputValue) â†’ Tracks movement for dodge direction
- Uses Unity's Input System message sending

DODGE MECHANICS:
- L key â†’ Perform dodge
- WASD direction â†’ Dodge direction
- No input â†’ Dodge forward/backward based on facing
- Mana cost â†’ Uses TryConsumeMana(10)
- Cooldown â†’ 2 seconds with UI display

PERFECT DODGE:
- Window: 0.2 seconds after damage or near enemies
- Effect: Time slow to 0.3x for 1 second
- Bonus: Restore 5 mana (half cost refund)

ðŸ§ª TESTING:
- T: Test damage (trigger perfect dodge)
- Y: Check dodge status
- U: Auto damage test (hold)

âš¡ KEY FEATURES:
âœ… Input System integration (OnDodge callback)
âœ… Movement direction from OnMove callback
âœ… Mana system with TryConsumeMana/AddMana
âœ… UI cooldown with direct component access
âœ… Invincibility frames (0.4s)
âœ… Perfect dodge with time slow
âœ… Visual trail and perfect dodge effects
âœ… Audio support for sounds

ðŸ”§ INSPECTOR SETTINGS:
- Dash Distance: 5 units
- Dash Duration: 0.3 seconds
- Cooldown Time: 2 seconds
- Mana Cost: 10
- Perfect Dodge Window: 0.2 seconds
- Time Slow Duration: 1 second (0.3x speed)
- Invincibility Duration: 0.4 seconds

ðŸ’¡ IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Uses Unity Input System callbacks (OnDodge, OnMove)
- Player must have PlayerInput component
- Action map "Gameplay" must be enabled
- Dodge action already bound to L key in InputActions

ï¿½ TROUBLESHOOTING:
- No dodge response? Check PlayerInput component and action map
- Wrong direction? Verify OnMove callback receives input
- UI not updating? Check SkillUISlot name is "Dodge"
- No effects? Verify AudioSource and sprite components
