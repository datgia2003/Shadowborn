# Air Dodge Physics Fix

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: Air dodge animation was interrupted by falling due to gravity, making it look like a "fall" animation instead of a proper air dodge.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Gravity Suspension During Air Dodge
- **Before**: Player falls during air dodge due to gravity
- **After**: `rb.gravityScale = 0f` during air dodge to suspend falling
- **Result**: Player maintains height during dash

### 2. Horizontal-Only Movement
- **Before**: Air dodge could move in any direction including down
- **After**: Air dodge only uses horizontal component of input
- **Code**: `Vector2 horizontalDodgeDirection = new Vector2(dodgeDirection.x, 0f).normalized;`
- **Result**: Clean horizontal dash movement in air

### 3. Controlled Gravity Restoration
- **Physics Reset**: Gravity restored after dash completes
- **Optional Hang Time**: Brief suspension before falling resumes
- **Clean Velocity**: Resets velocity to allow natural falling

### 4. New Inspector Settings
- **maintainHeightDuringAirDodge**: Toggle height maintenance (default: true)
- **airDodgeHangTime**: Extra hang time after air dodge (default: 0.1s)

## How It Works Now

### Air Dodge Sequence:
1. **Detect Air State**: Check if player is grounded
2. **Suspend Physics**: Set gravity to 0, stop vertical velocity
3. **Horizontal Dash**: Move only horizontally at current height
4. **Maintain Height**: Force Y position to stay constant during dash
5. **Optional Hang**: Brief pause at end position
6. **Restore Physics**: Re-enable gravity for natural falling

### Ground Dodge Sequence:
- **Unchanged**: Normal dash behavior with gravity active
- **No Physics Changes**: Ground dodge works as before

## Expected Behavior
- **Air Dodge**: Clean horizontal dash at constant height, then natural fall
- **Ground Dodge**: Normal dash movement with physics intact
- **Animation**: AirDodge animation should play properly without fall interference

## Debug Messages
- "Air dodge: Gravity disabled, maintaining height"
- "Air dodge hang time: 0.1s"
- "Air dodge completed: Gravity restored, natural falling resumed"

The air dodge should now look smooth and natural without falling interruption!
